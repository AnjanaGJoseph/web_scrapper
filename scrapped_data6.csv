The primary effect of the foot detox patch is detoxification. The patches will absorb your toxins after using them for the whole night. You can see that from the changing of the color after using it. 

The dirtier you see the footpad, the more toxins it has absorbed. After consistently using for a period, they will become cleaner each morning. 

That means most of the toxins in your body have been released already. Apart from your feet, you can also apply these detox foot pads onto other parts of your body, including the back, knees, elbows, etc.

Benefits of the Detox Foot Pads:
‚óè Release unwanted toxins.
‚óè Increase your energy level.
‚óè Reduce aches, pains, headaches, & tiredness.
‚óè Relieve stress.
‚óè Improve your metabolism.
‚óè Improve your blood circulation.
‚óè Improve weight loss.
‚óè Totally discreet - Works while you sleep.
‚óè Simple and Easy to use."

Many people in life give enough attention to toothbrushes and often ignore the health care of teeth.Only think that the teeth and velvet are standing, not rolled or rolled, and the brush handle is not broken, so continue to use it. It will not be replaced for a long time, so it can ""spoil"" the baby teeth.I don't know how old it is.

Serious consequences of use!Living teeth not only need to replace toothbrushes regularly, but also carefully"
